# create-pipeline delta spec

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Per-stage turn budgets

`.copperhead/config.json` SHALL accept an optional `stageMaxTurns` object mapping create-pipeline stage names to turn budgets. When a stage runs and its name has an entry, that value SHALL be the run's `maxTurns`; stages without an entry use the global `maxTurns`. Unknown stage names in the map SHALL be ignored.

#### Scenario: Stage-specific budget applies (AC-15.18)

- **WHEN** config contains `"stageMaxTurns": {"spec-seed": 60}` and the spec-seed stage runs
- **THEN** that stage's run enforces a 60-turn budget while other stages keep the global `maxTurns`

#### Scenario: Absent map changes nothing (AC-15.19)

- **WHEN** config has no `stageMaxTurns`
- **THEN** every stage uses the global `maxTurns` exactly as before

### Requirement: Content-aware stage completion

Stage completion SHALL be judged by repo state, not artifact existence alone: the schematic stage is complete only when the configured schematic contains at least one symbol AND the BOM/PINOUT tables are drift-clean against it; the layout-draft stage is complete only when a configured board exists containing at least one footprint AND the LAYOUT.md draft-quality marker is present. During a stage's agent run, `finish` SHALL refuse while the stage completion contract is unmet, and `create` SHALL halt the pipeline if the contract is not met, instead of advancing to later stages.

#### Scenario: Blank sheet does not complete the schematic stage (AC-15.23)

- **WHEN** the schematic stage attempts to finish but the configured schematic contains zero symbols
- **THEN** `finish` is refused, `create` reports the stage contract as unmet, does not advance, and a re-run of `copperhead create` resumes at the schematic stage

#### Scenario: Pipeline halts on planning-only output (AC-15.24)

- **WHEN** any stage's agent run attempts to finish without satisfying that stage's completion contract
- **THEN** `finish` is refused with the unmet contract condition, and later stages do not run
